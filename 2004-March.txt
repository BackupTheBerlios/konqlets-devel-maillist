Message-ID: <200403082132.04968.symbiont@berlios.de>

Currently, I'm getting the base web page up and running and working on 
the directory structure checked in to CVS.  This structure will be 
important as we move forward because we may end up needing the more 
complex architecture of having a kioslave communicate with a Konqueror 
plugin.

The kioslave is already following some of the steps needed to execute a 
bookmarklet via the URL line. However, there are hangups in the dialog 
box, metadata, and history cleanup.  These are very important issues 
and will need to be resolved before any release is cut.

This is all for now.
